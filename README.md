**A small library that implements a pattern similar to the command pattern**

This library is written for educational purposes in the Kotlin language,  
but it is fully functional although quite minimalistic


Commands are represented as implementations of the processor interface which  
accepts input data and outputs output dataprocessors are started for execution  
by an object that implements the executor interface
